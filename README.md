# About

Deciding between multiple good options can be difficult. Thankfully, there are thinking "tools" available to make these decisions easier. I first learned of one such tool, a "Decision Matrix", on [UnTools](https://untools.co/decision-matrix) and thought it would be nice to have as an easily editable worksheet that would also do the calculations for me. A JPG preview can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jeremyraby/decisionMatrix/blob/main/decisionMatrixPreview.jpg).
